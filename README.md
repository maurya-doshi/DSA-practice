# 📚 DSA Practice in C

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! 🚀  
This is my personal workspace where I’m building my understanding of core data structures and algorithms while sharpening my C programming skills.

## 📌 Reference
I am primarily using [this guide](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/getting-started) as my main reference for foundational concepts. However, it is not the sole source of my problems or exercises.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside
- Solutions to DSA problems written in C 🧩
- Organized folder structure by topic for neatness.
- Files are named iteratively based on the topic and order of practice.

**Example:**
Stacks/stack0.c — Basics of stacks
Stacks/stack1.c — Reversing a word using stacks

And so on!

- Clear and descriptive commit messages to track progress effectively.
